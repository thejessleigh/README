# jess leigh unrein's operating manual

## Introduction

My name is jess. I prefer to style my name all lower case when I have the ability to do so.

My pronouns are [ve/ver/vis](https://pronoun.is/ve/ver). I use the honorifics [Mx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mx_(title)) and [Miss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss).

Several of the sections in this README are inspired by [Lara Hogan's Questions for our first 1:1](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/).

### General conversation

In general I'm pretty friendly, but have difficulty modulating the volume of my voice and maintaining eye contact. If I am speaking too loudly, please gently let me know, and I'll recalibrate my volume. If I'm avoiding eye contact or engaging in too much eye contact, it's not personal. I'm not aware I'm doing it.

If you ask me a question I'll probably take a few seconds staring off into the distance before answering you. I'm not ignoring you, I'm processing your question and trying to come up with my best informed and well reasoned answer. I prefer written to verbal communication, especially if you would like me to relay something that requires research or careful consideration.

Sometimes I get overstimulated in social situations and need to leave early. Once my energy reserves are depleted, I'm not much fun to be around.

### Contact methods

The best way to get ahold of me quickly is by mentioning me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thejessleigh) or direct messaging me on slack. I startle very easily, so if we're working in the same physical space together, please send me a heads up on Slack or Twitter before tapping me on the shoulder.

If you can wait a day or two before I get back to you, send me an [email](mailto:j.l.unrein+contact@gmail.com). I'm more likely to respond to messages with informative subject lines.

### Feedback and Recognition

I like to give feedback through writing, and within 24 hours. I prefer to receive feedback the same way. In general I like to face interpersonal issues promptly, address the problem and move on. I do not do well in environments where people are likely to bottle things up or hold grudges.

I love giving people proper attribution if they've helped me out, delighted me, or otherwise done something awesome. I tend to call people out on Twitter or public slack channels. If you would prefer to receive recognition in some other way (in person, privately, etc.), please let me know.

### What kinds of communication do you struggle with?

I'm not a very good [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). If you're trying to bounce ideas off of me, especially if I don't know you're rubber ducking and assume you want prompt solutions, I get flustered, frustrated, and snippy. Rubber ducking is a great strategy for a lot of people, but I am not a good partner here.

I also like to know the purpose of a meeting before I go in. I don't necessarily need a full blown, minute by minute agenda. But I would like to know the purpose of the meeting and the desired outcome at least two hours before the meeting begins. This gives me time to prepare and feel confident communicating with the team.

I tend to shut down if I'm in an environment where I get interrupted repeatedly.

### What is your favorite baked good?

Homemade chocolate chip cookies.
